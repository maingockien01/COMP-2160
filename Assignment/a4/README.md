# Assignment 4

**File include:**
- ObjectManger.c ObjectManager.h - this is the files for garbage colelctor 
- list.c list.h - I separated 2 files because it was too messy for me to put 2 separated modules into 1 files. For me, it would be a bad module design for having 2 modules in 1 file. 
- main.c - This is the test suits written by Kien (me).
- test.c test.h - this is the simple test framework created by me. 

**Command to test**
`make run main=file_name`

file_name is the name of main file you want to run. 
For example if you want to run file main.c.
The command is:
`make run main=main`
